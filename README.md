# REST-API com Spring Boot

This project consists in a implementation of a REST API using some Spring ecosystem projects, such as Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA.

Requirements: Eclipse and Postman

Operating suggestions -> Open the project in eclipse -> Run the server -> Open Postman -> Check if the API is working through the Get method -> Still in Postman, add a name through the Post method -> Check if it was saved -> If so, the application is working :)
